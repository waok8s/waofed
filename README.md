## Overview

WAOFed optimizes workload allocation and loadbalancing on [KubeFed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed) with the following components:

- **RSPOptimizer**: Optimizes `FederatedDeployment` [weights](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md#distribute-total-replicas-in-weighted-proportions) across clusters by generating [`ReplicaSchedulingPreference`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md#replicaschedulingpreference) using the specified method. KubeFed handles the actual scheduling according to `ReplicaSchedulingPreference`.
- **SLPOptimizer**: Optimizes `FederatedService` loadbalancing weights across clusters by generating `ServiceLoadbalancingPreference` using the specified method. **A supported controller is required to handle the actual loadbalancing according to `ServiceLoadbalancingPreference`.**

## Getting Started

Supported Kubernetes versions: __1.19 or higher__

> 💡 Mainly tested with 1.25, may work with the same versions that [KubeFed supports](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md#create-clusters) (but may require some efforts).

Supported KubeFed APIs:
- `FederatedDeployment [types.kubefed.io/v1beta1]`
- `ReplicaSchedulingPreference [scheduling.kubefed.io/v1alpha1]`
- `KubeFedCluster [core.kubefed.io/v1beta1]`

New APIs Provided by WAOFed:
- `WAOFedConfig [waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/v1beta1]`
- `ServiceLoadBalancingPreference [waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/v1beta1]`

### Installation

Make sure you have [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) deployed on the cluster where KubeFed control plane is deployed, as it is used to generate webhook certificates.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

> ⚠️ You may have to wait a second for cert-manager to be ready.

Deploy the Operator with the following command. It creates `waofed-system` namespace and deploys CRDs, controllers and other resources.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Nedopro2022/waofed/releases/download/v0.2.1/waofed.yaml
```

### Deploy a `WAOFedConfig` resource

`WAOFedConfig` is a resource for configuring WAOFed. Deploy it with the name `default` to the cluster where KubeFed control plane is deployed.

`spec.kubefedNamespace` specifies the namespace from which WAOFed gets member clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/v1beta1
kind: WAOFedConfig
metadata:
  name: default # must be default
spec:
  kubefedNamespace: "kube-federation-system"
  scheduling:
    selector:
      hasAnnotation: waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/scheduling
    optimizer:
      method: "rr"
  loadbalancing:
    selector:
      hasAnnotation: waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/loadbalancing
    optimizer:
      method: "rr"
```

### Scheduling settings (RSPOptimizer)

RSPOptimizer watches the creation of `FederatedDeployment` resources and generates `ReplicaSchedulingPreference` resources with optimized workload allocation determined by the specified method.

Supported methods: `rr` (Round-robin, for testing purposes)

`spec.scheduling.selector` specifies the conditions for the `FederatedDeployment` resources that KubeFed watches.

> 💡 You can enable RSPOptimizer by default by setting `spec.scheduling.selector.any` to true.
>
> ```diff
>    scheduling:
>      selector:
> -      hasAnnotation: waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/scheduling
> +      any: true
> ```

### Deploy `FederatedDeployment` resources

> 💡 Ensure the namespace is federated by a `FederatedNamespace` resource before deploying `FederatedDeployment` resources.
> 
> ```yaml
> apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
> kind: FederatedNamespace
> metadata:
>   name: default
>   namespace: default
> spec:
>   placement:
>     clusterSelector: {}
> ```

When a `FederatedDeployment` with the annotation specified in WAOFedConfig is deployed, RSPOptimizer will detect the resource and generate an `ReplicaSchedulingPreference`.

```yaml
apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
kind: FederatedDeployment
metadata:
  name: fdeploy-sample
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/scheduling: ""
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      replicas: 9
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
            - image: nginx:1.23.2
              name: nginx
  placement:
    clusterSelector: {}
```


> 💡 You can see the resources with the following commands, and see the details by adding `-oyaml`.
> ```sh
> $ kubectl get fdeploy
> NAME             AGE
> fdeploy-sample   12s
> 
> $ kubectl get rsp
> NAME             AGE
> fdeploy-sample   12s
> ```

The generated `ReplicaSchedulingPreference` has an owner reference indicating that it is controlled by the `FederatedDeployment` so that it will be deleted by [GC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/) when the `FederatedDeployment` is deleted.

`spec.clusters` includes all clusters specified in `FederatedDeployment` `spec.placement` (RSPOptimizer parses the selector and retrives clusters), and `spec.clusters[name].weight` is optimized by the method specified in `WAOFedConfig`. This sample uses `rr` so all clusters have a weight of 1.

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.kubefed.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReplicaSchedulingPreference
metadata:
  name: fdeploy-sample
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: FederatedDeployment
    name: fdeploy-sample
    ...
spec:
  clusters:
    cluster1:
      weight: 1
    cluster2:
      weight: 1
    cluster3:
      weight: 1
  intersectWithClusterSelector: true
  rebalance: true
  targetKind: FederatedDeployment
  totalReplicas: 9
...
```

> 💡 Since `spec.intersectWithClusterSelector` is set to `true`, the generated `ReplicaSchedulingPreference` does not overwrite anything in the `FederatedDeployment`, allowing RSPOptimizer to watch the `FederatedDeployment` easily.

> ⚠️ **Edge cases not covered:**
>
> **`placement.clusters` has 0 items**
>
> KubeFed ignores `spec.placement.clusterSelector` if `spec.placement.clusters` is provided, so no clusters will be selected for the following case ([docs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md#both-specplacementclusters-and-specplacementclusterselector-are-provided)). However, RSPOptimizer currently does not recognize whether a list is nil (`null`) or has 0 items (`[]`), so it regards `spec.placement.clusters` as "not provided" and uses `spec.placement.clusterSelector` for scheduling.
> ```yaml
> spec:
>   placement:
>     clusters: []
>     clusterSelector:
>       matchExpressions:
>         - { key: mylabel, operator: Exists }
> ```

### Loadbalancing settings (SLPOptimizer)

SLPOptimizer watches the creation of `FederatedService` resources and generates `ServiceLoadbalancingPreference` resources with optimized workload allocation determined by the specified method.

Supported methods: `rr` (Round-robin, for testing purposes)

`spec.loadbalancing.selector` specifies the conditions for the `FederatedService` resources that KubeFed watches.

> 💡 You can enable SLPOptimizer by default by setting `spec.loadbalancing.selector.any` to true.
>
> ```diff
>    loadbalancing:
>      selector:
> -      hasAnnotation: waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/loadbalancing
> +      any: true
> ```

### Deploy `FederatedServices` resources

> 💡 Ensure the namespace is federated by a `FederatedNamespace` resource before deploying `FederatedService` resources.
> 
> ```yaml
> apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
> kind: FederatedNamespace
> metadata:
>   name: default
>   namespace: default
> spec:
>   placement:
>     clusterSelector: {}
> ```

When a `FederatedService` with the annotation specified in WAOFedConfig is deployed, SLPOptimizer will detect the resource and generate an `ServiceLoadbalancingPreference`.

```yaml
apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
kind: FederatedService
metadata:
  name: fsvc-sample
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    waofed.bitmedia.co.jp/loadbalancing: ""
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      selector:
        app: nginx
      ports:
        - name: http
          port: 80
  placement:
    clusterSelector: {}
```

> 💡 You can see the resources with the following commands, and see the details by adding `-oyaml`.
> ```sh
> $ kubectl get fsvc
> NAME             AGE
> fsvc-sample   12s
> 
> $ kubectl get slp
> NAME             AGE
> fsvc-sample   12s
> ```

The generated `ServiceLoadbalancingPreference` has an owner reference indicating that it is controlled by the `FederatedService` so that it will be deleted by [GC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/) when the `FederatedService` is deleted.

`spec.clusters` includes all clusters specified in `FederatedService` `spec.placement` (SLPOptimizer parses the selector and retrives clusters), and `spec.clusters[name].weight` is optimized by the method specified in `WAOFedConfig`. This sample uses `rr` so all clusters have a weight of 1.

```yaml
apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceLoadbalancingPreference
metadata:
  name: fsvc-sample
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: types.kubefed.io/v1beta1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: FederatedService
    name: fsvc-sample
    ...
spec:
  clusters:
    cluster1:
      weight: 1
    cluster2:
      weight: 1
    cluster3:
      weight: 1
...
```

> ⚠️ **Edge cases not covered:**
>
> **`placement.clusters` has 0 items**
> Same as [RSPOptimizer](#deploy-federateddeployment-resources)

### Uninstallation

Delete the Operator and resources with the following command.

```sh
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/Nedopro2022/waofed/releases/download/v0.2.1/waofed.yaml
```

## Developing

This Operator uses [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder), so we basically follow the Kubebuilder way. See the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html) for details.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Git
- Make
- Go
- Docker

### Run development clusters with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

The script creates K8s clusters `kind-waofed-[0123]`, deploys KubeFed control plane on `kind-waofed-0` and let the remaining clusters join as member clusters.

```sh
./hack/dev-kind-reset-clusters.sh
./hack/dev-kind-deploy.sh
```

> ⚠️ NOTE: Currently it is needed to re-create the clusters on every reboot as the script does not set static IPs to Docker containers.

### Run tests on kind clusters

The script creates K8s clusters `kind-waofed-test-[01]`, deploys KubeFed control plane on `kind-waofed-test-0`, let all clusters join as member clusters and runs integration tests.

```sh
# setup test clusters
./test/reset-clusters.sh

# basic tests (tests both scheduling and loadbalancing with "rr" method)
./test/run-basic-tests.sh

# test spec.scheduling.optimizer.method="wao"
./test/rspoptimizer-wao-setup.sh
./test/rspoptimizer-wao-run-tests.sh
```
